Most files are identical to the base Unciv game (except their compression).
Some are expanded on, amplified or similarly edited using same sources.
See [Sound Credits](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/blob/master/docs/Credits.md#sound-credits).

Exception:
* [Choir women, men and mixed](https://freesound.org/people/liezen3/sounds/479941/) by liezen3 as basis for 'choir' for free great person pick.
