# Higher quality sounds for Unciv (Mod)
Contains the default sounds of [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) in slightly higher quality.
In most cases the sources have just been compressed to a higher bitrate, with a few exceptions:
- 'nuke' is a bit longer, more suspense while the sirens are wailing.
- 'choir' is a different, more natural sound (personal preference).

See [Credits.md](Credits.md) for sources and attribution.

## Important - how to use
Currently, the game will not include these sounds unless the mod is active, which means, selected during new game creation.
An update to treat sounds like images and enable 'Permanent visual mod' to override audio, is at the moment just an idea.
