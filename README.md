# Higher quality sounds for Unciv (Mod)
Contains the default sounds of [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) in slightly higher quality.
Most files are identical to the base Unciv game, but resampled to 48kHz, normalized to a max peak amplitude of -5dB, and compressed to 160kbit/s Ogg Vorbis.
Some are expanded on, amplified or similarly edited using same sources.
- 'nuke' is a bit longer, more suspense while the sirens are wailing.
- 'choir' is a different, more natural sound (personal preference).

See [Credits.md](Credits.md) for sources and attribution.

## Important - how to use
Starting with Unciv 3.15.6 you can select "Permanent audiovisual mod" for this mod to have it override the builtin sounds.
When selected as mod for a new game, it works from Unciv version 3.14.13 upwards.
